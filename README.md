# Singleton
Artificial intelligence singleton is using deep learning algorythm and doesn't require another computer programs.

# Core
Start depth is a byte model(000-111). It helps to reach optimal perfomance. The main function of the application is splitting the byte into 2 channels by formula: {8 bits} = {2 bits} * {4 bits}.

# Deep Bridge
The bridge is providing 2 modes to run the AI:
1. Static data
2. Virtual data
   
We can store origin data and nested AI generated migration of data, updateable by 2 ways:
1. Language model
2. Program model

In general, bridge depth can log all AI output to debug.

# Getting started
To run this app
1. Create a blog website
2. Create a list of script for autoposting 
3. Create an event script to manage the list
4. Protect user input data with AI model 
5. Create a setting list of AI model to test and verify the tasks
