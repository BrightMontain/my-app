# Deep core
Starting the artificial intelligence depth as byte to reach optimal perfomance. Spliting a byte into 2 channels by formula: [8bit] = [2bit]*[4bit]. So the core can store data as the main program with an extended options.

# Bridge switch
AI could have a bridge with a switch inside to control a depth from 0 to full-1. It requires verification watermark over the app    
1. Static data to store stable code
2. Virtual data to store recent updates

# Getting started
To run this app
1. Create any blog page
2. Add any post form
3. Render posts on your blog page
4. Create AI model to split posts on your blog into source code and blog text
5. Create check tests with tags to make sure your AI is doing the same things as you
